This is a simple multimodule maven project example.

To run the example:

    $ mvn clean install
    $ cd app
    $ mvn tomcat:run

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/app/

It might take a while to download the maven tomcat plugin if you've never
run it before. Grab yourself a coffee and enjoy life in the meanwhile.
